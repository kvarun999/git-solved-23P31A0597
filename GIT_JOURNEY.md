## üß∞ Project Overview

This challenge tested my ability to handle **complex Git operations**, **merge conflicts**, and **branch workflows** in a simulated enterprise DevOps project.  
I resolved real merge conflicts across multiple branches (`main`, `dev`, `conflict-simulator`, and several feature branches) while maintaining project stability.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Conflicts Resolved

### üß© Merge 1: `main` + `dev` (6 Files)

#### `config/app-config.yaml`

- **Issue**: Port and environment mismatch (8080 vs 3000)
- **Resolution**: Unified configuration with environment-based settings

- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 min

#### `config/database-config.json`

- **Issue**: Different DB hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created environment-specific profiles
- **Strategy**: Added separate JSON objects for production/development
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 min

#### `scripts/deploy.sh`

- **Issue**: Conflicting deployment methods (direct vs Docker Compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic using `$DEPLOY_ENV`
- **Strategy**: Script now supports both modes safely
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 min

#### `scripts/monitor.js`

- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Created configuration object based on `process.env.NODE_ENV`
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 min

#### `docs/architecture.md`

- **Issue**: Contradictory architecture layouts
- **Resolution**: Combined both into unified documentation sections
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 min

#### `README.md`

- **Issue**: Different version numbers and features
- **Resolution**: Merged all with clear ‚ÄúProduction‚Äù and ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù labels
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 min

### ‚ö° Merge 2: `main` + `conflict-simulator` (6 Files)

#### `scripts/deploy.sh`

- **Issue**: Simulator build logic conflicting with production script
- **Resolution**: Added `SIM_MODE` flag for experimental deployment
- **Strategy**: Preserve production flow; simulator toggle optional
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 min

#### `scripts/monitor.js`

- **Issue**: Real-time vs simulated monitoring logic
- **Resolution**: Unified under condition `if (process.env.SIM_MODE)`
- **Strategy**: Default to production monitoring
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 min

#### `config/app-config.yaml`

- **Issue**: Simulator endpoints conflicting with real API routes
- **Resolution**: Added new `simulator` section in config
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 min

#### `config/database-config.json`

- **Issue**: Mock database config conflicting with real credentials
- **Resolution**: Introduced `"mode": "simulated"` section
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 min

#### `docs/architecture.md`

- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 min

#### `README.md`

- **Issue**: Conflicting documentation between stable and experimental builds

## üß† Advanced Operations (from reflog)

| Operation          | Commit / Action                             | Description                                 |

| `git rebase`       | Rebased `feature/another-feature` on `main` | Practiced linear history                    |
| `git cherry-pick`  | `feat: Add new feature`                     | Applied a single commit from another branch |
| `git revert`       | ‚ÄúRevert Bad commit‚Äù                         | Safely undid a faulty commit                |
| `git reset --hard` | Multiple                                    | Tested undo mechanisms                      |
| `git tag`          | `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`                          | Created version release points              |
| `git reflog`       | Viewed full command history                 | Verified all HEAD movements and merges      |

## üîç Most Challenging Parts

1. **Complex Merge Logic (deploy.sh)**  
   Understanding and integrating conflicting automation scripts without breaking production.

2. **Rebase Confusion**  
   Learning the difference between rebase vs merge and resolving detached HEAD states.

3. **Reverting and Resetting Safely**  
   Distinguishing between `revert`, `reset`, and `restore` was initially confusing.

4. **Conflict Markers Interpretation**  
   Learned the meanings of `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers precisely.

5. **Maintaining Consistency Across Docs**  
   Ensuring that merged documentation reflected both environments clearly.

## üß© Key Learnings

### üîß Technical

- Confidently handle merge conflicts across branches
- Effective use of `git diff`, `reflog`, and `status`
- Learned safe undo workflows with `revert` and `reset`
- Practical understanding of tags, rebasing, and cherry-picking

### üìò Best Practices

- Always review both sides of a conflict before resolving
- Keep commits atomic and meaningful
- Test merged code before committing
- Use clear merge messages with resolution strategies

### üß≠ Workflow Insights

- Conflicts are normal ‚Äî not errors
- Read both changes carefully before deciding
- Always document resolution strategies
- Git reflog is a _lifesaver_ for restoring lost commits

## ü™û Reflection

This Git Mastery Challenge completely changed my understanding of Git.  
I learned that **merge conflicts are opportunities to learn**, not obstacles.

By resolving multiple conflicts, reverting bad commits, tagging releases, and experimenting with rebases ‚Äî I became confident in handling **real-world DevOps version control workflows**.

**Final Verdict**:

> I now understand Git not as a tool ‚Äî but as a mindset for maintaining clean, collaborative, and recoverable history. üöÄ
